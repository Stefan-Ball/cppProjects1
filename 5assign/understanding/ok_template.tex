%\section*{Question 1}

I am to write a piece of software that can handle bowling scores according to a person's name for 1-5 players. The names must be stored in a C-style string. I am to follow the rules for the game of bowling, the denotations for how to show the score, and the correct way to add up the scores. In addition, I must have an array that holds the total score for each player and of all prior frame scores that is to be displayed to the screen. The player that has the most points at the end of the game wins. \newline

The number of pins that is knocked down after each bowl is equal to a random number between 0 and the number of pins standing. After each bowl, I will print the scoresheet with all scoring information. If a bowl isn't a strike or spare, I will print the score for the bowl. \newline

In this assignment, I will only use C-style strings. Input errors will result in a re-prompt.
