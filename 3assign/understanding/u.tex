\section*{Pseudocode}

I am to write a program that calculates the average for the class and specific categories. The program will also predict the users future grade depending on what the user thinks he will get on grades. I will make the program have a loop that asks the user what category they want to calculate: tests, assignments, labs, recitations, or the full class. This loop will also allow the user to quit. After the user inputs their decision, I will prompt them to input the scores for that category and then calculate the average. For lab, assignment, and test averages, each input will be treated as equal. For recitation, subcategories will have their own weight. When the weight is zero, it is not included in the final average. I will initialize all categories to zero. When the user wants to calculate the class average, I will prompt the user for the weight of each of the different categories.
