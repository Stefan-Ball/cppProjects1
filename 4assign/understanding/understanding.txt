I am to code the game "Wheel of Fortune". The game will be played with 1, 2, or 3 players depending on user input. First, the user will have to input the number of players and a phrase to guess. Then, the game will begin. First, the user will be asked whether they want to spin, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle. If they choose spin, they will be prompted to input a consonant if they land on the random numbers 1 through 20. If they guess correctly, then they will earn the dollar amount of the number of times that the letter appears in the phrase multiplied by their spin number, and they will get another turn. If they guess incorrecly, then it will be the next players turn. However, if they land on a 0, they lose a turn, their earnings for a round go to zero, and the next player gets three chances to spin, buy a vowel, or guess the phrase. A user can only buy a vowel if they have earnings greater than 10 dollars. The program will print out the number spun on the wheel, the number of letters for a guess, the total round earnings, the message with correctly guessed letters and empty letter slots, the correct message with total game earnings for all three players if the correct message is guessed, and a message containing the winning player when the game is over. The program should not allow incorrect input.
