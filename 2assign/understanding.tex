This problem is asking me to create a text adventure game where the user controls the path the program takes. It requires that I make the users path a combination of choice and chance. I am also to have at least five different paths that a user could go along. The user will be entering in one of the options that I give them to choose from, and I will have to store this answer and make it return the option that I want it to return. At least one of the paths must have five user inputs.
